# Perl Empty String Check Error

This repository demonstrates a common error in Perl when checking for empty strings.  The incorrect approach uses a numeric comparison, leading to potential issues. The correct solution uses a string comparison.

## Bug

The `bug.pl` file contains the erroneous code. It attempts to check if a string is empty by comparing its length to 0. This is problematic because a string containing only whitespace would still have a length greater than 0, but logically represents an empty string.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.pl` file shows the correct method using the `eq` operator for string comparison. This accurately checks for emptiness, even when considering whitespace.
